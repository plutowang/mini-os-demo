; Boot sector must be placed in a known, standard loaction,
; because BIOS does not know how to load the OS.
; The standard loaction is the first sector of disk
; i.e. cylinder 0, head 0, sector 0,
; the boot sector takes 512 bytes.

; To make sure that the "disk is bootable", the BIOS checks 
; that bytes 511 and 512 of the alleged boot sector are bytes `0xAA55`

; Note: x86 is little-endian
; `00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 aa`
